                        <h3>What I liked</h3>
                        <p>Isaac Asimov's 1955 book about time travel and social engineering goes deep into
                            philosophical themes such as what it means to curate history and its social implications. Do
                            check out for time travel paradoxes, twists, and some serious re-evaluation of what it means
                            to thrive as a society.</p>
                        <h3>What I wish was better</h3>
                        <p>The human characters are a bit one-dimensional, especially the female characters, which are
                            few and far between. Sure, the 50's wasn't the best time for women, but their portrayal
                            here, and in a lot of Asimov's books in general, is particularly simplistic.</p>
                        <h3>Memorable quote</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Out of danger and restless insecurity comes the force that pushes mankind to newer and
                                loftier conquests.</p>

                        <h3>What I liked</h3>
                        <p>This one is for all nostalgia lovers out there, Proust's poetic prose will make you reminisce
                            your childhood and how little things, like the smell of freshly baked cookies in your
                            grandma's oven, could make you fall into a dream-like state that would feel like a small
                            eternity. Do check out if you have ever stared at your surroundings and started to
                            contemplate whatever brought you to that moment. Also check it out for an interesting take
                            on the nature of memory and perception of time.</p>
                        <h3>What I wish was better</h3>
                        <p>It is hard to criticise this masterpiece, but if I had to, I would say it might feel a bit
                            dated and slow at times, however, if you stick through it, you probably will be rewarded.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Memorable quote</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to
                                constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up
                                like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is
                                created by the thoughts of other people.</p>

                        <h3>What I liked</h3>
                        <p>Umberto Eco's most well known fiction book can be described as a historical thriller
                            interspersed with theological, philosophical, and semiotic themes. What makes it interesting
                            is that it's a fairly modern, experimental book, set up in a 14th century monastery, which
                            turns out to be the perfect place for a murder mystery, as well as philosophical debates.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What I wish was better</h3>
                        <p>The first 100 pages can be a bit slow, but necessary in setting up the period and monastery
                            environment.</p>
                        <h3>Memorable quote</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Books are not made to be believed, but to be subjected to inquiry. When we consider a
                                book, we mustn't ask ourselves what it says but what it meansâ€¦</p>

                        <h3>What I liked</h3>
                        <p>I am a big admirer of James Joyce for his powerful, symbolism-full, and ultimately movingly
                            beautiful prose. This 800 page book follows a day in the life of Leonard Bloom and each
                            chapter is an experiment in 20th century narrative techniques. Do check out if you're into
                            stream of consciousness or greek mythology, since this is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What I wish was better</h3>
                        <p>This is admittedly and, infamously so, a very convoluted book and for a good reason. You will
                            need to read an analysis of each chapter in parallel to get the full meaning and all the
                            symbolism the author tried to convey. I found <a
                                href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ulysses/">Sparknotes</a> to be a very useful
                            resource.</p>
                        <h3>Memorable quote</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Every life is in many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers,
                                ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting
                                ourselves.</p>

                        <h3>What I liked</h3>
                        <p>Another great stream of consciousness book, Virginia Woolf's The Waves is mostly about the
                            characters rich inner lives and thoughts, rising and passing over the years, connected, like
                            waves. Do check out for beautiful language, especially her original and surprising epithets,
                            and its themes about identity and our shared human experience.</p>
                        <h3>What I wish was better</h3>
                        <p>It might be one of those rare cases where I can't find any flaws with a book, but hey, I
                            might be biased since Virginia Woolf is one of my all-time favourite authors.</p>
                        <h3>Memorable quote</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>I see nothing. We may sink and settle on the waves. The sea will drum in my ears. The
                                white petals will be darkened with sea water. They will float for a moment and then
                                sink. Rolling over the waves will shoulder me under. Everything falls in a tremendous
                                shower, dissolving me.</p>

                        <p>I absolutely loved this graphic novel about the foundations of mathematics. It mainly follows
                            Bertrand Russell's quest for the absolute truth and it (surprisingly?) ends up being a very
                            exciting journey as he stumbles into other 20th century influential mathematicians, such as
                            Kurt Godel, David Hilbert and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Do check out if you like puzzles,
                            mathematical paradoxes, and history walkthroughs.</p>

                        <h3>What I liked</h3>
                        <p>This Dostoyevsky novel has some of the most complex character development I have seen in a
                            book. It tackles deep philosophical themes, such as how to live one's life, and explores
                            this question by making its central characters have different answers and different world
                            views.</p>
                        <h3>What I wish was better</h3>
                        <p>I could sense some bias in the author's depiction of which life views are better and would
                            better match his own. I might have have preferred a slightly more neutral stance on the
                            matter, however, this might be my own bias.</p>
                        <h3>Memorable quote</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>I love mankind, he said, "but I find to my amazement that the more I love mankind as a

                        <h3>What I liked</h3>
                        <p>At this point, I guess there might be a theme in this list of stream of consciousness books,
                            but I find it a very stimulating and powerful narrative technique, and this is one of the
                            novels that makes full use of it. William Faulkner's novel is structured into 4 chapters,
                            each following the thoughts of a different character and their recollection of a particular
                            family event.</p>
                        <h3>What I wish was better</h3>
                        <p>This novel again might prove to be a bit convoluted for someone not familiar with the stream
                            of consciousness style, thus I would recommend using a guide in parallel.</p>

                        <p>As with other Asimov books, his portrayal of women feels dated, hence, one would have to

                        <h3>What I liked</h3>
                        <p>Written in 1931, I find Aldous Huxley's dystopian themes very relevant today, ranging from
                            genetic engineering to consumerism and the meaning of freedom. Do check out if you have ever
                            wondered what would happen if everyone was conditioned to be happy and comfortable all the
                            time.</p>
                        <h3>What I wish was better</h3>
                        <p>Not much to criticise here overall, I found the ideas stimulating and a more subtle, but
                            relevant dystopia than Orwell's 1984.</p>
                        <h3>Memorable quote</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for
                                misery.</p>
